App Overview: 
This app is an e-commerce store that was made to replicate the style of the Amazon Web App. The app is made with React, Javascript, CSS, and Firebase(for the backend). This app allows you to create an account, log into your account, add items to purchase into a shopping cart, make payments, and view orders you have made. This app is very simple and light weight and was built for the purpose of learning rather than practical use.

User Authorization:
To create an account, add your desired email address and password, and use the same email and password to sign in. When going to the '/orders' route, you will be redirected to the '/login' route to sign in.

Payments:
This app can indeed take payments via credit card however the processor is in test mode to prevent anyone from making real payments. When entering payment information, type in '42' until all fields are filled in. In other words, type in '4242424242424242' for the credit card number, 04/24 for the expiration date, 242 for the CVC, and 424242 for the zip code.
